Globally, transportation activities produce 75% of total environmental CO2 emissions . Con- sequently, the reduction of emissions from transportation is a worldwide objective.
The combustion of fossil fuels stands as a ubiquitous practice intertwined with modern civi- lization, powering industries, transportation, and domestic utilities. However, this reliance has ushered in a pressing concern: the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. As a primary greenhouse gas, CO2 significantly contributes to atmospheric changes and climate disturbances, exacerbating global warming and its associated environmental impacts.
