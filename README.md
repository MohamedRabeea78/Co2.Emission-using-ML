Globally, transportation activities produce 75% of total environmental CO2 emissions . Con- sequently, the reduction of emissions from transportation is a worldwide objective.
The combustion of fossil fuels stands as a ubiquitous practice intertwined with modern civi- lization, powering industries, transportation, and domestic utilities. However, this reliance has ushered in a pressing concern: the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. As a primary greenhouse gas, CO2 significantly contributes to atmospheric changes and climate disturbances, exacerbating global warming and its associated environmental impacts.
This study addresses the imperative need for accurate modeling and prediction of CO2 emissions from vehicles using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. By harnessing machine learning algorithms and datasets containing comprehensive vehicular parameters, we aim to develop mod- els capable of forecasting CO2 emissions with high precision.  Our goal is to contribute to the creation of sustainable and smart environments by providing policymakers with valuable insights and decision-support tools for designing and implementing effective environmental poli- cies.
